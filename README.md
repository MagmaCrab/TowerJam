# Carcerato

This is our entry for the towerJam in 2016. 
Escape from the tower with a ball and chain as your only weapon!

## How to Play

You can control the main character with the arrow keys or wasd.
Swing the ball and chain with space, and pause the game by pressing escape.
When you've unlocked the charge upgrade, you can hold space to release a 
devastating swing attack.

Kill all enemies to advance to the next level. When you've collected enough XP,
you may choose an upgrade to improve the character's skills

You win when you descend all 30 levels of the tower!
